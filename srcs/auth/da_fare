IV.3 User Management
This module delves into the realm of User Management, addressing crucial aspects
of user interactions and access control within the Pong platform. It encompasses two
major components, each focused on essential elements of user management and authentication: user participation across multiple tournaments and the implementation of remote
authentication.
• Major module: Standard user management, authentication, users across tournaments.
◦ Users can subscribe to the website in a secure way.
◦ Registered users can log in in a secure way.
◦ Users can select a unique display name to play the tournaments.
◦ Users can update their information.
◦ Users can upload an avatar, with a default option if none is provided.
◦ Users can add others as friends and view their online status.
◦ User profiles display stats, such as wins and losses.
◦ Each user has a Match History including 1v1 games, dates, and relevant
details, accessible to logged-in users.
Be carefull, the management of duplicate usernames/emails is at your
discretion. You must provide a solution that makes sense.
