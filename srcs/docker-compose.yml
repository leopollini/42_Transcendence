# naming conventions:
#   - volume names SHOULD end by "_db"
#   - services CAN have full name
#   - every service/volume/network name SHOULD be lowercase
#   - any hidden service/volume/network SHOULD be named in a different way (e.g.: ".servicename")


# notices:
#   - EVERY service MUST depend on the logger



# sample volume
  # logger:
  #   driver: local
  #   name: logger
  #   driver_opts:
  #     o: bind
  #     device: /home/leonardo/data/logger
  #     type: none


# sample container: receiver
  # receiver:																# container
  #   container_name: receiver							# coniainer name (alias)
  #   build: ./requirements/receiver				# Dockerfile directory
  #   image: mariadb:42
  #   depends_on:														# container is built after ...
  #     - logger
  #   networks:															# connected to networks ...
  #     - app-network
  #   env_file:															# path to .env
  #     - .env
  #   volumes:															# accessible volumes
  #     - wp:/var/www/html
  #   ports:																# communication ports with outer environment
  #     - "443:443"
  #   command: ["bash", "echo"]							# execute a command outside (?) container
  #   restart: always												# in case of crash restarts service
